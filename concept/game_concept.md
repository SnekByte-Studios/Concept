# Economic RPG Tycoon

### Lore Overview
The game world is an open ocean with countless islands and archipelagos. The land masses scattered on the horizon are all inhabited by different races and civilizations.<br>

Far away in the distance, the player will occassionally be able to see the "metropolis". The metropolis is the human civilization. It's the exploitative, consquest oriented antagonistic nation located on the only continent in the world, and whose leader will be the main antagonist. Visually, the metropolis looks like the city of the future; High-end technology, dense population, futuristic transport and infrastructure, etc.<br>

The player is a human born in the metropolis. When they were still very young, the economic situation in the metropolis had started turning for the worse, and after a series of unjust evictions and bankrupcies, main character's relative, who comes from the scattered lands, flees the city with the protagonist and moves out to a far away remote island.<br>

The playable part of the game world is a distant, remote and hard to get to place with not a lot to offer. This is why the metropolis hasn't yet conquered it.<br>

The player won't be able to get to the metropolis, but they will eventually encounter soldiers of the metropolis doing recon in these far away lands. Those representatives of that far-away nation will be high level enemies equipped with end-game weapons, vehicles and armor.<br>

Throughout the game, the player's task will be to fight off the forces of the metropolis, rejuvenate the economy of the scattered lands, unite the divised and diverse nations, and step up as their leader to fight for the scattered lands' independence.<br>

### Gameplay Overview

#### Farms
<br>
Farm is a type of player-owned business. Farms can grow plants or livestock. They can be upgraded to increase quality and quantity of produced good. Everything that's produced on a farm can spoil, so better storage/transport solutions need to be incorporated.<br>
Goods growing in the fields attract thieves and wildlife. Those dangers can be mitigated via hiring security, building fences, or taming some dangerous animals that will fend it off for you.<br>
<br>

#### Ships
<br>
There are going to be many different types of ships for every situation in this game; Exploration/recon ships, cargo ships, naval combat ships etc.<br>
Every ship can be upgraded in a variety of ways. There are going to be statistics upgrades such as upgrading the ship's speed, and there are also going to be unique upgrades such as acid resistant hull plating which allows the vessel to travel in acidic waters.<br>
Ships can also be equipped and personalised; Different kinds of weapons (e.g. cannons/harpoons) can be installed on decks of compatible ships, different crates (for better spoilage prevention/carrying capacity) can be equipped on cargo ships, ships can be coloured with different paints, sails can be painted and replaced, etc.<br>
The ships are going to be independent vehicles, i.e. They can move without player's interaction. With sail powered vessels, the player will be able to set sail and direction and the ship will move independent of whether the player's at the steering wheel or not. This will allow the player to walk on deck while the vessel is moving and interact with different parts of the ship (i.e. sails or anchor). It will also make it possible for the player to lose their ships, forcing them to use them more responsibly.<br>
<br>

#### Combat
<br>
Combat system will define 3 different types of damage; Ranged, melee and magic. The player will be able to specialize in any number of them.<br>
There aren't going to be skill trees, but instead, each profession has a level which goes up with the damage dealt. Certain milestone levels will allow the player to accept certain quests whose completion teaches the player a new skill. An example of a new skill could be an ice bolt spell, or a triple shot skill.<br>
Some weapons will also have a minimum viable profession level to equip.<br>
<br>

#### Land vehicles
<br>
The game will define some land vehicles used for transporting goods over ground. Those vehicles will include farm wagons, pseudo trucks etc.<br>
Those vehicles can be upgraded and customized like ships.<br>
Unlike ships, those vehicles cannot be independent and they won't move without a driver.<br>
There are only going to be two categories of land vehicles; Recon and Cargo. There won't be combat types (like tanks).<br>
Land vehicles can be obtained via either purchasing or building them (more expensive at first but cheaper in long term).<br>
<br>

#### Mounts
<br>
The game will define different three types of mounts; Naval, Land and Aerial.<br>
Naval mounts will allow the player to traverse water. Land mounts will allow the player to move on land, and aerial mounts will allow the player to fly.<br>
Some of the mounts will be able to carry goods, but most of them won't, and usually, this ability will come at a great price in mount's speed.<br> 
Most mounts will be able to attack while being ridden - This will come in handy in naval or aerial combat.<br>
Mounts can be summoned, but they won't always show up instantly. Only some of the mounts will have the ability to appear at the player's position instantly, others will have to travel from the place they were left at.<br>
<br>

#### Crops and Soil
<br>
The game will have many different types of crops.<br>
Each crop is only compatible with a narrow pH range. Planting it in soil with higher/lower pH than needed will result in the crop dying or not developing fully.<br>
Different islands will have different pH levels of their soil and as such, will be populated with different plants.<br>
The player can travel to different islands and unlock different plants by acquiring their seeds. They can also collect soil from any land that they own and move that soil to another farm field on another island.<br>
Each crop, once collected, will spoil in storage and transit. The spoilage will be mitigatable via the incorporation of better storage such as salt barrels or freezers.<br>
<br>

#### Activities
<br>
Since the world is going to be somewhat of a sandbox to the player, they will be able to make money in a variety of ways. So far, the expected activities include: Lumbering, Fishing, Mining and Foraging.<br>
The player will be able to automate and upgrade all of those activities.<br>
The player will be able to do these things for either money or crafting items.<br>
<br>

#### Economy
<br>
Each island will have its own local economy, and each local economy will be simulated; There will be companies working on every island and producing a certain amount of goods every iteration. They will also be able to appreciate or depreciate in production and stock value, and the player will be able to affect that.<br>
Price of an item will be dependent on the access that island has to that resource, so for example, if an island produces 40k carrots every day, the price per carrot on this island will be higher than that on an island which produces 80k carrots every day. This also means that flooding a market with one type of resource only, would soon enough become a bad economic decision.<br>
Apart from local markets and economies, there is also going to be a global economy which will be a small factor affecting prices everywhere. This economy will be affected by all trades on all islands.<br>
If the player is doing well and the global economy keeps on appreciating for long enough, there will be special items listed on the marketplace for limited time only. They will be awesome unique, and very expensive items.<br>
<br>

#### Workers and Automation
<br>
Player owned businesses can be automated with workers.<br>
There are many different kinds of workers for different tasks, such as security, ship crew or farm workers.<br>
Each worker levels up with time being employed. To stay employed however, they need to be paid a living wage.<br>
Workers can be kidnapped or killed by pirates or criminals. When kidnapped, the player will be able to rescue them. If killed, the player gets to keep their wage money.<br>
<br>

#### Gameplay Concept
Player starts out on the starting island with nothing to their name. They're stuck there until they've made enough money to build a ship and leave the island. That money will usually be made by creating the player's first farm.<br>

The player has to build and upgrade their businesses accross different islands and then set up trade routes to sell their products at the highest markup possible.<br>
